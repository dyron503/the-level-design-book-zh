# Assets & Resources

Where to get free art assets (models, textures, materials) for use in levels

This page lists free art assets (models, textures, materials) for use in levels.
  * We only list sites with robust free download plans + generic file formats that work in most engines.
  * "CC license" refers to free assets with permissive [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license) or [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) style licenses.
  * We also list other types of resources:
	* [Books](./books.md): list of other level design books, with brief summaries
	* [Quake resources](./quake.md): list of free texture .WADs and other Quake-specific files

## Prototyping blockout textures
When making the [blockout](../process/blockout/), we recommend using gridded placeholder textures to prototype the level geometry. This helps establish consistent scale and [metrics](../process/blockout/metrics/) for the level.

## Skyboxes
A skybox is a special type of 6-sided cubemap texture that gives the illusion of a distant sky background. Contemporary game engines usually use procedural sky shaders / skydomes, but sometimes the old fashioned ways are more effective.

Quake / Half-Life style skyboxes

[OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/art-search-advanced?keys=&field_art_type_tid%5B%5D=9&sort_by=count&sort_order=DESC) | 10000+ free tileset packs and sprites, mostly retro / pixel art style but lots of variety, basically the first place to look | (on) [X]

To make 2D levels, you'll usually want a tile-based level editor. See [Tools](../tools.md#2d-level-editors).
