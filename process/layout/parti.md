# Parti

the core idea / concept of a layout

In architecture, the parti is the central idea / concept of a project. Can you reduce the building down to its most important structural aspects in 1 sentence?

Similarly, level design benefits from defining a central core idea that anchors the rest of the design. If you're able to pitch your level with a clear parti statement or sketch, then your collaborators (or even the player) will understand your intent better.
